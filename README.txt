Hey there fine folks at IGN!

My name is Aung Thar but my nickname is Zack. I've answered all the questions you asked and I've listed out where you can find them and what to look at. 

You can find each answers in their folders. For problem one and two, they'll just be in a text file. Problem three's folder also have a text file but it also contain a Java file.

Problem four contains a text file with a link to a youtube video I made to answer the question. Hopefully the video is enough to show how passionate I am about working with you guys!

Also I've included a brief bio and a work history in the folder called Bio.

If there's any problems, please contact me at athar@ucsd.edu.

Thank you!
Zack Thar
